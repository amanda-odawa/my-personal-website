            <p>Hello. I'm Amanda Odawa, a recent BBIT graduate from Strathmore University and an ongoing Software Engineering student at Moringa School. I chose to continue with my studies at Moringa School so as to improve my software development skills, and develop proper communication and negotiation skills necessary for one's survival in today's competitive Tech Industry. Outside of my school schedule, I try to keep myself busy on the weekends through a part-time job. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, and playing video games. Here's a bit more about me:</p>

            <ul class="likes">
                <li>Favorite animal - My dog Lucy (also cats)</li>
                <li>Favorite food - Fries (potatos in general)</li>
                <li>Favorite color - Depends on the day and my mood (right now its pastel yellow)</li>
                <li>Dislikes - Durian (and other smelly foods)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Throughout my academic, professional, and life journey, I have built a strong foundation in system architecture and software development, alomg with other important life skills.</p>
            
            <ol class="skill-items">

                <li>Collaboration and Problem-Solving Skills</li>
                <li>Cooking (Baking really, aka the 'Important life skill'. In my defense, cake <span>is</span> technically food. And as Marie Antoinette said ~<span>Let them eat cake.</span> Honestly, she didn't really say this but we can most definitely <span>pretend</span> that she did!)</li>
